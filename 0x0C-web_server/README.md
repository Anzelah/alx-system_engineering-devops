2. Task 1
Requirements:

Install nginx on your web-01
server
Nginx should be listening on port 80
When querying Nginx at its root / with a GET request (requesting a page) using curl, it must return a page that contains the string Hello World!
As an answer file, write a Bash script that configures a new Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements (this script will be run on the server itself)
You can’t use systemctl for restarting nginx

3. Requirement:

provide the domain name only (example: foobar.tech), no subdomain (example: www.foobar.tech)
